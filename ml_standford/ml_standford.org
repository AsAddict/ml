Learning Algorithms is important, but more important
to know how to convey them into practical problem.

** Introduction
							   
*** Before the course

The AI dream of someday building machines as intelligent as people.
And many AI researchers believe the best one to towards that goal
is through *learning algorithms mimic how the humans' brains learn*.
Just knowing the algorithms and knowing the math *isn't enough* if
u don't know how to actually get this stuff to work on problems. the
ranges of machine learning applications:

+ Database mining

  Large data-sets from growth of web are very useful to humans for analysis.
  E.g:
  1. Web Click Data

     analyzing(machine learning)  web click data help those internet companies
     know and serve the users better

  2. Medical Records

     Using machine learning to analyzing the records and turn them to medical
     knowledge help human to know diseases better is increasing necessary in
     medical field.

  3. Computational Biology

     Machine learning algorithms figure out what collected information about
     the DNA sequences means to human.

  4. Engineering field

     architecture field is still unexplored so much :)

+ Applications which cant be programed by hand
  
  We cant program to solve problems but we could make robotic program
  to learn how to solve the program by itself. E.g.
  1. Autonomous helicopter

    It's hard to program to drive a helicopter but we could make a computer
    program to learn how to fly the helicopter by itself.

  2. N-L-P (Nature Language Processing)
  3. Computer Vision
  4. Self-customizing programs
    
    E.g. Amazon product recommendations, the computer program learns and
    customizes itself to specific customers based on their preferences.

  5. Understanding human learning (brain, real AI)

*** What is machine learning?
**** The old definition as 1959 by Arthur Samuel. 
     Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being
     explicitly programmed.

     e.g. samuel built a checker program(robot) to play thousands of games  to "understand" what kind of boards to win or lose, and eventually learn how to play checker. Although Samuel was not a good a checker himself but his "robot" make him better checker.
**** The modern definition by Tom Mitchell
     A computer program is said to learn from experience E with the respect
     to some task T and some performance on T, improved with experience E  

     e.g. G-mail spam filter robot classifies the spam and non-spam emails (T) automatically.

       its E is whether the users label some specific emails are spam or not.

       its P is the number of fraction of emails correctly classified as spams or
       not spams.
**** The main machine learning algorithms:
     + The main two types
       1. Supervised learning
       2. Unsupervised learning
     + Others
       1. Reinforcement learning
       2. Recommend systems

*** Supervised Learning Introduction

    Problem was provided with the so-called "right-answer-sample-data"
    (term: trianing set) , supervised learning problem focus more on 
    prediction by "learning" from training set.

**** Linear Regression 						    

     To predict *the continuous values* based on the sample data("right-answer")
     (the saying continuous value here, I guess, is because what the prediction
     's value must be one value of some specific continuum.
     E.g. The house prices sample:

     [[file:r/0010.jpg]]
     [[file:r/0011.jpg]]

     (the car keep trying to predict continueous values of steering directions
     to drive itself)
**** Classification (logistic Regression)

     To predict the *discrete value* based on the training set
     E.g.

     [[file:r/0030.jpg]]

     In the example, algoritmn analyse and classify the datasets
     into two types (magnigetn or benign), so we could predict a
     specific user-provided data weather magnigetn or benign.

     Tips: in some questions, the discrete values may more than 2
     categories e.g. magnigetn1, magnigetn2, magnigtn3 .., benign
       (*Multi-class classification*).
     And may be more than 2 features (>= 2-dimentions). e.g.considering
     tumor position.. as well  and even maybe inifinit features in
     some examples (obviously, we don't have infinit memory to store 
     this data). Fortunally, *the support of vector machine* may give
     some help.
     
*** Unsupervised Learning Introduction Clustering Algorithm

    This is no any known categories provided in advance versus the
    classification in supervised learning. Instead, the typical one
    about unsupervised learning algorighm is to analyse the dataset
    and divide them into different clusters. (i.e. try to find the
    structure or inner category of the dataset hidding inside)
    Let's see some examples in our life.
     
    + Group the same new from different source

    + Cluster gene-block have different influences on human

    + Sounds seperation
