** auctex on emacs
** mactex 2.2G
   the tex system on mac, it's located on */usr/local/texlive*
** xquartz (x11 on mac)
   for auctex-mode on emacs to view .tex 's output
** auctex-mode for emacs 	   
   dependencies : mactex, ghostscript
   built the auctex-mode for emacs manually without el-get, 
   based on the instruction here: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AUCTeXonOSX
*** unclear 							    :unclear:
    inline-preview for tex file seems not working ("FILE NOT FOUND xx.aux)
*** ghostscript 
    for auctex
*** cdlatex-mode
    for quick inserting math template for auctex-mode
    and org-cdlatex-mode(mirror) 
** python3.2000
   /usr/local/bin has a file named python, then installing a newer one giving up
   overwrite this file which keeps directing to the old and unavailable file.
   python3.2 seems stable for some other package
*** pip
    without pip3 installed , installed manually by getpip.py https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py

*** numpy, matplotlib

*** jedi
    sudo ~/.emacs.d/.python-environments/default/bin/pip /
    install --upgrade ~/.emacs.d/el-get/jedi/
** subversion   
   installed by homebrew for emacs version control
   
** ac-octave
   both el-get and package has the problem of "octave-inf" problem,
   maybe emacs-minor-version wrong for my emacs version.
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   ;(if (and (>= emacs-major-version 24) (> emacs-minor-version 3))
   ; (require 'octave)
     ;; for emacs 24.3 or below
   ; (require 'octave-inf))
   (require 'octave)
   #+end_src
   ac-octave could work now with some strange problem:
   Blocking call to accept-process-output with quit inhibited!!
